## **Game rules and mechanics**
Players must match pairs of cards based on memory. The goal is to match all pairs in the fewest moves and the shortest time possible.

### **Game board:**
* The game board consist of a grid of cards, face down.
* Grid size are adjusted depending on difficulty: 
    * Desktop:
        * Easy: 4*4 cards (totalt 16 cards, 8 pairs)
        * Medium: 6*4 cards (totalt 24 cards, 12 pairs) 
        * Hard: 8*4 cards (totalt 32 cards, 16 pairs)

    * Tablet and mobile:       
        * Easy: 4*4 cards (totalt 16 cards, 8 pairs)
        * Medium: 4*6 cards (totalt 24 cards, 12 pairs)
        * Hard: 4*8 cards (totalt 32 cards, 16 pairs)

### **Card matching**
* Every card has a twin, two of the cards has the same symbol.
* Users flip two cards at the time, trying to find the matching pairs.
* If the card matches, they will disapear from the grid. If not, they flip back face down.

### **Moves and scoring**
* Each attempt to match two cards count as a move.
* The game tracks the number of moves made.
* Users are scored based on the number of moves: fewer moves results in a higher score.

### **Timer**
* A timer starts when the game begins, tracking how long the player takes to match all pairs.

### **End of game**
* The game ends when all card pair are matched.
* Users recive feedback on their performance, including time and total moves. 


## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
This is an example of the features section, your going to talk about each section of the page and what it offers for the navbar for example
​
* The user is given links to each section of the page
* Each option is presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
* on smaller screens a hamburger menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
​
#### *features
​
* This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A webpage is a living beast it's going to evolve past the initial stages of release generally, it's always good to discuss where you this the page may go in the future
​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
We always have bugs in development, a few bullet points here to talk about bugs you found and how you fixed them, in later projects this will be more detailed
​
* Issue - When on mobile the user had horizontal scroll with items overflowing
* Cause - The images had absolute positioning and caused them to go off screen
* Resolution - Changed the width of the image to stay within the confines of the screen.
